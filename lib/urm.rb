# The Urm module provides functionality to create and manipulate instructions
# for the Unbounded Register Machine (URM). The URM is a theoretical model used
# in computer science to study the principles of computation and algorithms.
#
# This module includes classes for different types of instructions such as setting
# a register, incrementing a register, decrementing a register, conditional jumps,
# and stopping the machine. It also provides methods to parse instructions from
# strings and convert them back to their string representations.
